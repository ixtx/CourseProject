- 'CodeBook.md': Explains the variables, data, and data transformations.

- 'tidyData.txt': A table of mean measurements by SubjectID and Activity from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, using only its mean, standard deviation, and mean frequency variables.

- 'run_analysis.R': The R script that crated the tidyData from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. Please see the comments in the R script and CodeBook.md for explanation of this script.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'CodeBook.md' for more details. 

Each record in the original dataset contains:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Notes for the original Dataset: 

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
